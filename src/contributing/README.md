# Contribution Guidelines

Please follow the guidelines below to contribute to any Parsec repository.

- Contributions follow the GitHub Standard Fork and Pull Request workflow. [This
   guide](https://gist.github.com/rjdmoore/ed014fba0ee2c7e75060ccd01b726cb8) might help you if you
   are not sure!
- The changes are accepted under the [Developer Certificate of
   Origin](https://developercertificate.org/), so you must add the `Author` and `Signed-off-by`
   fields to your commit message. See [1]. By default, `git` should add the `Author` field
   automatically so you just have to make sure that you commit your changes with `git commit
   --signoff` in order to add the `Sign-off-by` field.
- The changes submitted need to pass the various Continuous Integration checks before being merged.
- The files of this project use a copyright notice referring to "Contributors to the Parsec
   project". The contributors are specified in the
   [`CONTRIBUTORS.md`](https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS.md) file in
   the `parallaxsecond/parsec` repository. If you want to, please make a pull-request in that
   repository to include your name or your organization.

[1] Required commit message fields:
